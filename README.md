# MythWeaversStarWars5e
This script requires the [TamperMonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en&pli=1) Chrome extention (or for whichever browser you are using).
It is meant to be used with Myth-Weavers.com 's Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition character sheets, to be used with the Star Wars 5e conversion. This script only modifies the display of the character
sheet in your browser - nothing changes on Myth-Weavers' database. Therefore, a computer/browser without this script would still see the unmodified character sheet.

Once installed, set the "Deity" on your character sheet to "Star Wars":

![Diety set to "Star Wars"](documentation/dietyStarWars.png)

Save your character sheet, then reload your page.
